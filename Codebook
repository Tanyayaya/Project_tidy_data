train_data:includes the subjects,labels and sets of training data
test_data:includes the subjects,labels and sets of testing data
data:includes both training data and testing data
data_good:includes the subjects,labels and averages and standard deviations for each measurements in tests and training.
data_tidy:includes the averages of each variable for each activity and each subject.
data_tidy:
subject:each number stands for a person who takes part in the test or training;
activity:six kinds of activities being measured in the project;
measurements:suffix'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
             prefix 't' to denote time.
             prefix  'f' to indicate frequency domain signals.
             mean(): Mean value
             std(): Standard deviation
tBodyAcc-XYZ & tGravityAcc-XYZ:The acceleration signal("tAcc-XYZ") from the smartphone accelerometer in standard gravity units 'g'
was captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then it was filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth
filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise.
Then the acceleration signal was separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ)using
a low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
tBodyGyro-XYZ:The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.
It was captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then it was filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth 
filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ:The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals. 
tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag:The magnitude of these three-dimensional signals
were calculated using the Euclidean norm.
fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag:a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) 
was applied to some of the signals above.
