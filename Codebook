train_data:includes the subject,label and set of training data
test_data:includes the subject,label and set of testing data
data:includes both training data and testing data
data_good:includes the subject,label and mean and standard deviation for each measurements in tests and training.
data_tidy:includes the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
data_tidy$subject:each number stands for a person who take parts in the test or training.
data_tidy$activity:six kinds of activities being measured in the project.
data_tidy$tBodyAcc-mean()-X: Average of the acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. 
The same description applies for the 'tBodyAcc-mean()-Y' and 'tBodyAcc-mean()-Z' files for the Y and Z axis. 
data_tidy$tBodyAcc-std()-X:standard deviation of the acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. 
The same description applies for the 'tBodyAcc-std()-Y' and 'tBodyAcc-std()-Z' files for the Y and Z axis.
